Comments are mainly used to make our code more readable. 
They are completely hidden from the webpage and only show up in the code.
Commenting on your code is a good practice as it helps us to express what the code is doing. 
It can act as an anchor for you if you want to change your code in the future.
In a collaborative environment, code comments are helpful for other developers as well.
